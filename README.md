# Image-based Scan-to-BIM for Interior Scene Reconstruction

## Introduction
This research project aims to develop an image-based Scan-to-BIM approach to facilitate room-level reconstruction of interior scenes, covering common building elements such as floors, ceilings, walls, doors, windows, and lift openings. The approach consists of four stages: image-based point cloud generation, boundary surface modeling, semantic projection and boundary refinement, and BIM reconstruction, as shown below.

## Structure
This repository intends to include the raw data and codes of the proposed approach, including:
1. **Point cloud pre-processing using PCL library** (In preparation)
2. **Image segmentation script (YOLOv8 trained on HBD dataset)** (In preparation)
3. **3D-to-2D projection for point cloud segmentation** (In preparation)
4. **Semantic surface reconstruction** (In preparation)
5. **BIM generation using Revit Add-on** (Available now)
6. **The raw images, camera paths, and point clouds of the six indoor scenes** (Available now) at:
